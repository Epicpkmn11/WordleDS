# Wordle DS
A clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) for the Nintendo DS(i). The word list matches the official NY Times version, as long as you keep up to date. A sharable text file will be made as `sd:/_nds/WordleDS/Wordle DS/share.txt` on completion or can be accessed as a QR code from the statistics menu.

## Building
Follow devkitPro's [Getting Started](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) guide to install libnds, devkitARM, and grit, then simply run `make`.

## Modding
Wordle DS allows for modding with custom word lists, graphics, music, etc. See [the wiki](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/WordleDS/wiki/Modding) for details.

To download mods, see the [mod list page](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11/WordleDS/blob/mods/mods.md) on the mods branch of this repository.
